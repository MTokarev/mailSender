### About

Simple app that sends **Happy BirthdayðŸŽ‰** e-mail to your users.

### Prerequisites

- Despite this is a cross-platform app make sure that you are running it from AD-joined computer.
- SendGrid account (you can register free account on https://sendgrid.com). It's required to send email to users.
- Https (TCP443) access to the sendgrid.com (API call will be used to send emails over).

### How It works

App scans domain and gets a list of ActiveDirectory enabled users. Then it reads `extensionAttribute3` and deserialize it into json object.
If `extensionAttribute3` has **"DOB"** key in format "mm/dd/yyyy" then it would be parsed into `DateTime` object and compared with DayOfYear property. If it would match email will be sent by using html template located in the path specified in `appsettings.json` **-** `MailTemplateHtml`:

```
{
  "Logger": {
    "LogPath": "logs/log.log"
  },
  "SendGrid": {
    "ApiKey": "Do not store your keys into git repos",
    "SenderEmail": "no-reply@domain",
    "SenderName": "NoReply",
    "MailSubject": "Happy Birthday {{name}}!",
    "MailTemplateHtml": "mailTempl.html"
  }
}
```

Logging is enabled by default and logs both console and file. You can specify log location (optional). If not specified `logs` folder will be created in the working directory.

Html template and message subject have a tag `{{name}}` that would be replaced with ActiveDirectory users `DisplayName`.

### How to set extensionAttribute3

Use ActiveDirectory powershell module and run:

```
Set-ADUser userName -Add @{extensionAttribute3='{"DOB": "02/14/1985"}'}
```
